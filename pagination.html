            <img src="photo-1539627831859-a911cf04d3cd.avif" alt="Cubing" style="width:100%;height:300px;">
           <p>The Rubik's Cube is a 3D combination puzzle invented in 1974[2][3] by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture
        Ernő Rubik. Originally called the Magic Cube,[4] the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Pentangle Puzzles in the
        UK in 1978,[5] and then by Ideal Toy Corp in 1980[6] via businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer.[7]
        The cube was released internationally in 1980 and became one of the most recognised icons in popular culture. It won the
        1980 German Game of the Year special award for Best Puzzle. As of January 2024, around 500 million cubes had been sold
        worldwide,[8][9][10] making it the world's bestselling puzzle game[11][12] and bestselling toy.[13] The Rubik's Cube was
        inducted into the US National Toy Hall of Fame in 2014.[14]
        
        On the original, classic Rubik's Cube, each of the six faces was covered by nine stickers, with each face in one of six
        solid colours: white, red, blue, orange, green and yellow. Some later versions of the cube have been updated to use
        coloured plastic panels instead. Since 1988, the arrangement of colours has been standardised, with white opposite
        yellow, blue opposite green and orange opposite red, and with the red, white and blue arranged clockwise, in that
        order.[15] On early cubes, the position of the colours varied from cube to cube.[16]

        An internal pivot mechanism enables each layer to turn independently, thus mixing up the colours. For the puzzle to be
        solved, each face must be returned to having only one colour. The cube has inspired other designers to create a number
        of similar puzzles with various numbers of sides, dimensions and mechanisms.
        
        Although the Rubik's Cube reached the height of its mainstream popularity in the 1980s, it is still widely known and
        used. Many speedcubers continue to practise it and similar puzzles, competing for the fastest times in various
        categories. Since 2003, the World Cube Association (WCA), the international governing body of the Rubik's Cube, has
        organised competitions worldwide and has recognised world records.</p>
